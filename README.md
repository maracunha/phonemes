## Motivations

My daughter needs to improve her words with the phoneme /s/. The speech therapist gave exercises and drawings for her to train this phoneme.
To make learning easier and to make the visualization of the figures more interesting, I created this little App for her.

## Running the Project

Run `npm start` to start the built-in web server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Versions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Special thanks
Débora Klemz, speech therapist who designed this exercises
